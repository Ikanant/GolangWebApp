# GolangWebApp
MVC designed Web App written in GO 

This is a DEMO application I developed trying to further improve my GOLANG skills. I felt in love with the language
and I wanted to implement my MVC Web Application knowledge using as many new tools as I can.

Feel free to contact me for any suggestions,

Thank you for reading...
