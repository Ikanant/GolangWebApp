					will allow me grow as an engineer and also learn how to become a
					successful leader in todayâ€™s tech world. Computer Science is no
					longer a single-player game and I am well aware that in order to
					succeed with a project, collaboration with a group of individuals
					who share the same passion and energy as I do for the field is
					essential. I look forward to meeting colleagues that I can count on
					for help and mentorship. I want to write code for a purpose by
					striving to develop efficient and relevant programs to best help
					clients. I love what I do and I will continue to better myself in
					my work.`,
